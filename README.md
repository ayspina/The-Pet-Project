<p><i>The Pet Project</i> is a web-based application built by developers <i>Ayana Spina, Joseph Cuozzo, and Landon Grams.</i> It is designed to provide 
an approach for pet-related donations as well as services that avoids involving pet shelters. The hope is to decrease the amount of work necessary for 
shelters and potentially even alleviate some of their overcrowding situation.</p>
<h2 align='center'>How It Works</h2>
<p>Upon logging in, <i>user</i> can access available resources, leave comments on them, and post the resources
that they have available. <i>User</i> is able to delete/edit their own posts as needed in order to keep everything as up-to-date as possible. Resources are
categorized by type and can be accessed via the navigation bar. Beyond that, resources also have a description, an image, and a field to fill in the
general location of the donation.</p>
